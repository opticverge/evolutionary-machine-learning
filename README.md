# OpticVerge Evolutionary Framework

This is a framework for evolving solutions to many types of problems using different methods. It will include features such as fully evolvable parameters with a vast array of choices for initialisation, change and evolution over time. The first example of this approach will be based on a hyper parameter optimisation framework for machine learning frameworks such as scikit learn, tensorflow and more.
